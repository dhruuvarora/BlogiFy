# BlogiFy - A Blog Application
## Overview

The Blog Application is a simple web application designed for managing blog posts. It provides a platform where users can sign up, sign in, and create blog posts with optional cover images. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for data storage, and EJS for server-side templating.

This project showcases a fundamental implementation of user authentication, file handling, and CRUD operations. It is intended as a demonstration of how to build a full-stack web application with a focus on practical functionality and structure.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, sign in, and log out. Passwords are hashed before storage for security.
- **Blog Management**: Authenticated users can create new blog posts, including optional cover images. Posts are stored in MongoDB.
- **File Uploads**: Cover images for blog posts are uploaded and served as static files.
- **Dynamic Pages**: Pages are rendered using EJS templates, allowing for dynamic content and user-specific views.
